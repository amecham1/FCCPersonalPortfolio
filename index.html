        <p class=my-info>
            I'm a monster. What's Spanish for "I know you speak English?"
            <br> First place chick is hot, but has an attitude, doesn't date magicians.
            <br> But I bought a yearbook ad from you, doesn't that mean anything anymore?
            <br> Army had half a day. There's so many poorly chosen words in that sentence.
            <br> I'm half machine. I'm a monster. I'm a monster. Say goodbye to these,
            <br>because it's the last time! It's a hug, Michael. I'm hugging you. Say goodbye to these,
            <br> because it's the last time! I'm a monster.
            <br>No, I did not kill Kitty.
            <br> However, I am going to oblige and answer the nice officer's
            <br>questions because I am an honest man with no secrets to hide.
